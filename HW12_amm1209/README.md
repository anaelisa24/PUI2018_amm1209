# Assignment 1

1. Read in the data used for HW11
2. Plot the time series
3. Sum the data along the ride type axis to get a 600x194 matrix, containing the amount of rides per station.
4. Plot the FFT for each of the 600 time series to see the periodicity of the data. I plotted the data both in months and in weeks.
