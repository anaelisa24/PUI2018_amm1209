In general the plot is easy to read and understand and there are no ambiguities on the quantities shown. The selection of a bar plot is appropriate, as it allows the reader to understand that each bar corresponds to one year. Although both axis are labeled, I think it would help the user understand the data easier if the y axis was labeled **Numer of fatalities** instead of just **fatalities**. Because this plot only shows one type of data, the use of only one color is appropriate. Finally, this plot is honestly reproducing the data and even the caption explicitly says that the data for 2018 is not complete. Overall, the plot is easy to follow and its elements are correclty placed, besides changing the label of the y axis, I would make the caption a little bigger so it does not look so blurry.
