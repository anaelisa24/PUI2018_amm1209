# Assignment 1

1. Downloaded the data from the lab folder and saved it in the PUIDATA folder.
2. Copied all the steps that were previously done in the lab and interpreted the value of the Likelihood Ratio test to determine that both models (linear and squared) were not statistically significantly different.
3. Performed the same steps for the second variable (y2) and interpreted the value of the Likelihood Ratio test to determine that the square model fit the data statistically significantly better than the linear model.
4. Used the Log-likelihood value from the tables to calculate the Likelihood Ratio and then used the Chi-Sq table to get the p-values corresponding to those LR values with 1 degree of freedom.
